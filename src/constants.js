The platform was designed to ensure tamper-proof storage of critical vehicle events such as manufacturing details, ownership transfers, service history, insurance validations, and maintenance logs.

  We implemented this using AWS Managed Blockchain with Hyperledger Fabric to achieve secure, decentralized, and verifiable tracking across stakeholders including manufacturers, dealerships, service centers, and insurers. My role involved designing and developing secure RESTful APIs that acted as the bridge between the off-chain services and blockchain smart contracts. I also worked on DynamoDB query optimization, AWS Lambda workflows, and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions and Jenkins.

  This project pushed me to think like a systems architect — balancing performance, security, and reliability — while collaborating with cross-functional teams. It wasn’t just a technical challenge, but a real-world opportunity to build something trustworthy, scalable, and mission-critical.`,

My key focus was building reliable backend services for transaction processing, user management, and reporting — with blockchain used for enforcing trust, ownership, and tokenization.

    Projects like Fleet&Queue, Upay, SurePay, and ADB Pay Events required tight integration between Node.js APIs and Ethereum smart contracts. I designed service orchestration layers that handled payment processing, token flows, and dynamic role-based controls. On the blockchain side, I helped develop ERC20 contracts, multisig approval mechanisms, and contract-based revenue distribution flows.

    I also integrated IPFS for distributed content delivery and built utility microservices to bridge Web2 and Web3. These systems were deployed into live environments with complex user hierarchies and real-time data sync between off-chain and on-chain components. My work spanned REST API design, smart contract integration, CI/CD, and scalable backend architecture.`,

    While backend remained my main focus, I also contributed to Solidity development, deploying contracts on testnets, and integrating Web3.js into the backend service layer. My work ensured seamless communication between UI, backend, and on-chain components for features like streaming access control (Sports) and secure investment handling (PeerFund).

        "GreenPoint Fleet is a blockchain-enabled electric vehicle (EV) charging and fleet management platform tailored for commercial and organizational fleets. It allows users to register vehicles, join fleet circles, locate nearby charging stations, and initiate charging sessions through a web app. Fleet Owners can approve driver requests, manage group charging activity, and oversee payments from a shared fleet wallet. All transactions and charging data are handled via Ethereum smart contracts using ERC20 tokens, with automatic revenue splitting among stakeholders such as EV companies and third parties. The platform includes real-time map navigation, filterable reports by user, company, or country, and administrative controls for managing vehicle types, fuel categories, and geographic zones.",
